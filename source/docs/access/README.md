Configuring access control

## Why?

* Protecting sensitive files and directories by setting proper permissions and ownership, and by using Extended Attributes (xattr). 
* Avoiding security related problems with Set User ID (SUID) and Set Group ID (SGID).

## How?

* [Discretionary access control (DAC)](dac.md)
* [Access control lists (ACL) and shared directory management (SDM)](acl.md)
* [Mandatory access control (MAC)](mac.md)
