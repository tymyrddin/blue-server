## What?

Be prepared to be surprised.

## Why?

A disaster can strike at any time. We always do our best to design the most stable and fault-tolerant server implementations we possibly can, what matters most is how we are able to deal with disasters when they do happen.

## How?

* [Preventing disasters](prevention.md)
* [Using git for configuration management](git.md)
* [Implementing a backup plan](backup.md)
* [Using bootable recovery media](brm.md)

## Notes

* Do not store backups or old versions of software on the production system.
* Automate making backups.
