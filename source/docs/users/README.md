# Introduction

## What?

Securing user accounts through smart configuration of sudo, using complex passwords, disabling root access and 
locking down home directories.

## Why?

The principle of least privilege states that each user should only have enough access to perform their daily tasks.

## How?

* [Configuring sudo](sudo.md)
* [Disabling root access](disable-root.md)
* [Locking home directories](homes.md)
* [Configuring password complexity](passwords.md)
* [Configuring other password requirements](other-reqs.md)
