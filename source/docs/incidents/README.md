# Introduction

## What?

A good incident response plan will include a list of guidelines to be followed with regard to  implementing new servers and managing current ones (isolating compromised servers, strategically patching and recovering servers). Create guidelines for things such as user management, server management, application installations, security, and procedure documents.

## Why?

We always do our best to design the most stable and fault-tolerant server implementations we possibly can. We can not prevent every type of incident that could possibly happen but having a good plan in place and following that plan will lessen the likelihood an incident becomes a disaster.

## How?

* [Preventing incidents](prevention.md)
* [Using git for configuration management](git.md)
* [Implementing a backup plan](backup.md)
* [Using bootable recovery media](brm.md)

## Notes

* Do not store backups or old versions of software on the production system.
* Automate making backups.
