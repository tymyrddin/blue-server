# Introduction

Using a VPN is a way to map out a private network that only the servers can see. Communication will be fully private 
and secure. Other applications can be configured to pass their traffic over the virtual interface that the VPN software 
exposes. This way, only services that are meant to be used by clients on the public internet need to be exposed on 
the public network.
