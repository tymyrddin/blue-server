## Mind

Something small and distant broke through the cloud layer, trailing shreds of vapour. In the stratospheric calm the sounds of bickering came sharp and clear. "You said you could fly one of these things!" "No I didn't; I just said you couldn't!" ~ Rincewind and Twoflower attempt broomstick flying (Terry Pratchett, The Light Fantastic)
